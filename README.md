This report presents the synthesis of a final year project conducted at FIND SOLUTIONS, 
aiming to develop a predictive model for electricity consumption using data collected by smart 
sensors. The project focuses on preprocessing regularly spaced time series data and training 
machine learning models, including novel deep learning methods for consumption prediction. It 
involves various approaches to address different stages of a machine learning project, including data 
preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and basic forecasting. Furthermore, it encompasses time series 
regression, including tree-based methods, as well as feature engineering. Additionally, it requires 
model training and evaluation, as well as studying forecasting models. Lastly, it also involves 
exploring deep learning strategies. The selected models have shown good results in terms of 
performance metrics, particularly LightGBM. Moreover, deep learning approaches have also 
demonstrated promising results, indicating improved accuracy. This study examines a dataset 
collected from multiple households, with a sampling rate of 10 seconds, including measurements of 
real power, voltage (Vrms), and date/time, with the aim of analyzing and understanding energy 
consumption patterns.
